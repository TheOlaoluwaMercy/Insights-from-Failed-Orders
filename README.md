# Insights-from-Failed-Orders
This project involves the analysis and exploration of failed orders, with a specific focus on understanding orders cancelled by the client (excluding those cancelled by the system). The goal is to uncover what, when, and where these cancellations are happening.
## The following questions would be answered:
1. Understanding Failed Orders
    - How many total failed orders occurred?
    - Who cancelled the orders â€” client or system?
    - What is the proportion of each cancellation type?
2.  When Do Client-Cancelled Orders Happen?
    - What hours of the day has the highest client cancellations?
    - How do cancellations vary across parts of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)?
3. Where Do Client-Cancelled Orders Occur?
    - Which addresses have the most client-cancelled orders?
    - Which cities show the highest number of failed orders?
4. How Does Time Influence Cancellations?
    - What is the average ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) at the time of order?
    - How long (in seconds) before the client cancels the order?
5. Do clients tend to cancel before a driver is assigned or after?
